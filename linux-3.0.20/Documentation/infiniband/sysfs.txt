SYSFS FILES

  For each InfiniBand device, the InfiniBand drivers create the
  following files under /sys/class/infiniband/<device name>:

    node_type      - Node type (CA, switch or router)
    node_guid      - Node GUID
    sys_image_guid - System image GUID

  In addition, there is a "ports" subdirectory, with one subdirectory
  for each port.  For example, if mthca0 is a 2-port HCA, there will
  be two directories:

    /sys/class/infiniband/mthca0/ports/1
    /sys/class/infiniband/mthca0/ports/2
